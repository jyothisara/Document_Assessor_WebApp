# CS615-WebAppProject

A web application for accessing document assessment tasks online framed in NodeJS with Express framework, an accompanying RESTful API and MongoDB storage, interfaced with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. This application is developed as part of academic coursework.

The Document Assessor website is developed for users to carry different document assessments online which are provided by researchers. Researcher assigns different assessment tasks (that contain various resources) to different users who had once registered. Users can signin to the online account and choose to perform resources(documents) assessments by signing up for the assessment tasks assigned to them. The users should submit an assessment form where they provide feedback about the resources they assessed. This will help the researcher to know the feedback about the resources they assigned. The developed application does not cover the researcher view, i.e. creation and assigning of resources and tasks. These data are inserted manually to database.
