This folder contains 2 mean stack applications, learned and implemented using tutorials for handson and better understanding on building a webapp.
These apps are not fully functional (front end portion is incomplete).
The main focus was to implement the backend, especially for CRUD operations. These apps are build using NodeJs and Mongodb with mongoose as ODM.
